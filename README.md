# MLPR
The task of the project is the development of a binary classifier able to distinguish male (𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙 = 0) and female (𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙 = 1) samples in a dataset composed by image embeddings.
Everything present in the final report can be generated by running the main.py file but, since there are a lot of experiments and the execution takes a long time, it is suggested to run only the classifiers you are interested in from the specific python file.
